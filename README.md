## Key value store (CommonCRUD)
Read section *Tables* if you did not create a table yet.

### GetAll
### Get
### Create
### Update
### Delete
### Filter
You can filter by any (nested) property on your document.
See the table below for operators.

```erlang
erlstore_persistence:filter ( Table, Filters, User ).
```

Filters must be a list of tuples, a filter tuple consists of property, operator, value. 
See the example below.

```erlang
erlstore:persistence:filter ( Table, [{ <<"_system.created">>, <<">=">>, 1519138939 }], User ).
```

Example object that would match:

```erlang 
#{
    "id" => "c6a007de-4b82-4008-9b5c-d009e55782ae",
    "name" => "kak",
    "_system" => #{
        "access" => "superadmin",
        "created" => 1519138939,
        "last_editor" => "superadmin",
        "owner" => "superadmin",
        "updated" => 1519138939
    }            
}
```

#### Operators
| Operator      | Description              |
| ------------- |:------------------------:| 
| isset         | Is set                   | 
| isnotset      | Is not set               | 
| =             | Exactly equal to         | 
| /             | Exactly not equal to     | 
| <             | Lower than               | 
| =<            | Equal to or lower than   | 
| >             | Greater than             | 
| >=            | Equal to or greater than | 



## Tables
### Create
```erlang 
> erlstore_persistence:createTable ( my_table ).
```
### Delete
```erlang erlstore_persistence:deleteTable ( my_table ).```

## Domains
### Create
The domain object must contain a `name` and `groups` property.
Name must be of type string.
Groups is of type list of strings.

Eg.

```erlang #{ <<"name">> => <<"Example domain">>, <<"groups">> => [ <<"admin">>, <<"guests">> ] }```

### Delete

## Users
### Create
The user object must contain an `id` and `domain` property.
Id must be of type string and is both the id as well as the username for that user.
Domain is a combination of the `domain` id and `domain group list position` seperated by a `:`. This property is used for Access Control.

Eg.

```erlang <<"6a3e55d2-5344-4226-a136-a6cf18d3bccc:0">>```


### Delete


## Access Control
Access control in Erlstore is done on a per document basis.


### Using AC, or not
All functions of the API have a AC variant and one without.

Eg. With and without AC respectively.

```erlang erlstore_persistence:get ( movies, <<"abf18cca-fe78-48b7-a465-b00ae8d9fc44">>, User )```

```erlang erlstore_persistence:get ( movies, <<"abf18cca-fe78-48b7-a465-b00ae8d9fc44">> )```


> ## Don't drink too much of the cool-aid
>
> If you use create or update functions without AC these documents are created or updated with
> SuperAdmin permissions. Hence 'normal' users cannot access them.
> 
> Using non AC variant of the API is like typing `sudo` in your terminal.
> It's not bad, but it comes with extra responsibility!

## Change feeds (Î±)
Erlstore currently supports basic change feeds. The Access control sytem is not yet implemented on these feeds, nor is filtering. *GEEKNOTE: Access control actualy uses the filter module to do the job hence these two go in tandem.*

The change feeds work on a per table basis. This means you will listen to changes on a specific table and receive messages if something in that table changes. It is as easy as that.

### Subscribe
```erlang erlstore_persistence:subscribe ( Pid, Table ).```

As `Pid` is the process that will receive messages and `Table` is the table to subscribe to.
Messages are standard Erlang messages.

### Change types
- Create
- Update
- Delete

#### Structure
```erlang 
{ ChangeType, Table, Data, [OldData] }
```

#### Create
```erlang 
{create, my_table, #{ <<id>> => <<"my_new_document">>, <<"kakkies">> => 3 } }
```

#### Update
```erlang 
{update, my_table, #{ <<id>> => <<"my_new_document">>, <<"kakkies">> => 9 }, #{ <<id>> => <<"my_new_document">>, <<"kakkies">> => 3 } }
```

#### Dete
```erlang 
{delete, my_table, <<"my_new_document">> }
```
