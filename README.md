# Erlstore
The real-time document store build for reliability, 
magically spreading over both memory and disk storage.
A modern database with an intuitive REST API and Erlang API.
Websockets, access control, filtering and a web based control-panel.

**THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE Want to contribute? mail vanwel@eyedouble.nl** 

## Document store
Read section *Tables* if you did not create a table yet.
All methods take an optional user map as last argument to enable Access Control filtering.
For consiseness these variations of the API are omitted below.

### GetAll
```erlang 
erlstore_persistence:getAll ( my_table ).
```

### Get
```erlang 
erlstore_persistence:get ( my_table, <<"id">> ).
```

### Create
*object should not contain an ID erlstore will create an UUID automatically. It will be overwritten*
```erlang 
erlstore_persistence:create ( my_table, #{ <<"data">> => <<"my_data">> } ).
```

### Update
```erlang 
erlstore_persistence:update ( my_table, Id, #{ <<"data">> => <<"my_new_data">> } ).
```

### Delete
```erlang 
erlstore_persistence:update ( my_table, Id ).
```

## Filters
You can filter by any (nested) property on your document.
See the table below for operators.

```erlang
erlstore_persistence:filter ( Table, Filters, User ).
```

Filters must be a list of tuples, a filter tuple consists of property, operator, value. 
See the example below.

```erlang
% one filter
erlstore:persistence:filter ( Table, [{ <<"_system.created">>, <<">=">>, 1519138939 }] ).

% multiple filters
erlstore:persistence:filter ( Table, [
    { <<"_system.created">>, <<">=">>, 1519138939 },
    { <<"_system.owner">>, <<"/">>, <<"irsan">>
]).

% filter with AC enabled
erlstore:persistence:filter ( Table, [{ <<"_system.created">>, <<">=">>, 1519138939 }], User ).

```

Example object that would match:

```erlang 
#{
    "id" => "c6a007de-4b82-4008-9b5c-d009e55782ae",
    "name" => "test",
    "_system" => #{
        "access" => "superadmin",
        "created" => 1519138939,
        "last_editor" => "superadmin",
        "owner" => "superadmin",
        "updated" => 1519138939
    }            
}
```

### Operators
| Operator      | Description                   |
| ------------- |:-----------------------------:| 
| isset         | Is set                        | 
| isnotset      | Is not set                    | 
| =             | Exactly equal to              | 
| /             | Exactly not equal to          | 
| <             | Lower than                    | 
| =<            | Equal to or lower than        | 
| >             | Greater than                  | 
| >=            | Equal to or greater than      | 
| fllen         | Flat list length equals       | 
| flmem         | Flat list has exactly member  | 



## Tables
### Create
```erlang 
erlstore_persistence:createTable ( my_table ).
```
### Delete
```
erlang erlstore_persistence:deleteTable ( my_table ).
```

## Domains
### Create
The domain object must contain a `name` and `groups` property.
Name must be of type string.
Groups is of type list of strings.

Eg.

```erlang 
#{ <<"name">> => <<"Example domain">>, <<"groups">> => [ <<"admin">>, <<"guests">> ] }
```

### Delete
Not available yet due to AC logic.

## Users
### Create
The user object must contain an `id` and `domain` property.
Id must be of type string and is both the id as well as the username for that user.
Domain is a combination of the `domain` id and `domain group list position` seperated by a `:`. This property is used for Access Control.

Eg.

```erlang 
<<"6a3e55d2-5344-4226-a136-a6cf18d3bccc:0">>
```


### Delete
Not available yet due to AC logic.



## Access Control
Access control in Erlstore is done on a per document basis.


### Using AC, or not
All functions of the API have a AC variant and one without.

Eg. With and without AC respectively.

```erlang 
erlstore_persistence:get ( movies, <<"abf18cca-fe78-48b7-a465-b00ae8d9fc44">>, User )
```

```erlang 
erlstore_persistence:get ( movies, <<"abf18cca-fe78-48b7-a465-b00ae8d9fc44">> )
```



> ## Don't drink too much of the cool-aid
>
> If you use create or update functions without AC these documents are created or updated with
> SuperAdmin permissions. Hence 'normal' users cannot access them.
> 
> Using non AC variant of the API is like typing `sudo` in your terminal.
> It's not bad, but it comes with extra responsibility!

## Change feeds (Î±)
Erlstore currently supports basic change feeds. The Access control sytem is not yet implemented on these feeds, nor is filtering. *GEEKNOTE: Access control actualy uses the filter module to do the job hence these two go in tandem.*

The change feeds work on a per table basis. This means you will listen to changes on a specific table and receive messages if something in that table changes. It is as easy as that.

### Subscribe
```erlang 
erlstore_persistence:subscribe ( Pid, Table ).
```

As `Pid` is the process that will receive messages and `Table` is the table to subscribe to.
Messages are standard Erlang messages.

### Change types
- Create
- Update
- Delete

#### Structure
```erlang 
{ ChangeType, Table, Data, [OldData] }
```

#### Create
```erlang 
{create, my_table, #{ <<id>> => <<"my_new_document">>, <<"tests">> => 3 } }
```

#### Update
```erlang 
{update, my_table, #{ <<id>> => <<"my_new_document">>, <<"tests">> => 9 }, #{ <<id>> => <<"my_new_document">>, <<"tests">> => 3 } }
```

#### Delete
```erlang 
{delete, my_table, <<"my_new_document">> }
```

## Data dumps
Erlstore currently supports dumping to an implementstion specific data file. Erlstore uses mnesia to store data.
One can dump to a mnesia specific binary dump-file. Erlstore can import this dump-file as well

**Mnesia and thuss Erlstore data is node specific for distribution purposes. This means a dump needs to be made, renamed to be used with another node and imported on that node. Erlstore handles this for simply dump(export, "folder/file") on node A and dump(import, "folder/file") on node B.**

```erlang 
erlstore_persistence:dump ( export, "folder/to/dump/to/filename" ).
```
Will create a file `filename.node@192.168.0.1.erlstore` in the directory provided in the path.


```erlang 
erlstore_persistence:dump ( import, "folder/to/dump/to/filename.node@192.168.0.1" ).
```
Will import and if applicable automatically do node renaming in the dump file before import.
*Note that the node name in the file name are merely for your information and the node recognition is not dependend on the file's name*
